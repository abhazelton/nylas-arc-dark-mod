# Nylas Mail Arc Dark (mod) Theme

This is a modified version of the Arc Dark theme for mail client [Nylas Mail](https://www.nylas.com/nylas-mail/)

# Purpose of this theme
All credit goes to [varlesh](https://github.com/varlesh) for making the theme.  I liked it but found that on some emails the inverted colors in the email content just didn't look exactly right.  In this modified version, plain text emails will still show the content using the theme colors.  However, HTML emails will display only the content of the email using the original styling.  All other UI components have remain unchanged.

# Installation
1. Download [ZIP-archive](https://github.com/abhazelton/nylas-arc-dark-mod/archive/master.zip).
2. Open Nylas Mail preferences and go to "Plugins" tab.  Click "Install plugin" and select the zip archive.  You can also simply extract this file to ```~/.nylas-mail/packages/```.
3. Go to the "Appearance" tab and select "Themes".  Choose "Arc Dark (mod)".
